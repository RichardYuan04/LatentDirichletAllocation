# MTR Accident Text Analysis - LDA Topic Modeling
## Project Overview
This project was completed during an internship at MTR Corporation, focusing on accident text analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling techniques. The project performs in-depth analysis of accident reports to discover accident patterns, identify key risk factors, and provide data-driven insights for MTR's safety management.

## Background
As Hong Kong's essential public transportation system, MTR serves millions of passengers daily. Accident prevention and safety management are paramount to operations. Through analyzing historical accident reports, we can:

Identify common accident types and patterns
Discover potential risk factors
Provide evidence for prevention strategy development
Optimize safety management processes
Technical Methodology
LDA Topic Modeling Principles
LDA is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm particularly suitable for document topic discovery. In accident analysis, LDA can:

`Automatically discover hidden topics`: Identify different accident types and patterns from large volumes of accident reports
`Probabilistic distribution modeling`: Each document (accident report) contains probability distributions over multiple topics
`Keyword extraction`: Generate most relevant keywords for each topic to facilitate understanding of accident characteristics
